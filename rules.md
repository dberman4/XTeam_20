# X-Team 20 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Group leader will assign tasks, and if a team member is unable to complete a task, it will be reassigned 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will use a text file on GitHub as a "to-do" list and check off tasks as they are completed with the the date and time they are completed at


## How will will (we?) communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Message each other in the group-chat and be specific. Meeting before deadlines so that we can help eachother in person. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We communicate on time and check if everyone finished their tasks on time. If somebody is struggling in some points, we will meet in person and help them finish.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Make sure to communicate that you recieved messages in the groupchat
